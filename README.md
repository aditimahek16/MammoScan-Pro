## Theme : 
Creating a brighter future for Breast health by leveraging cutting-edge technology and compassionate care. Unleash the potential of AI to drive impactful solutions and foster a healthier tomorrow for all.

## Problem Statement:
The existing methods of diagnosing breast cancers through Ultrasound scans often involve time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis by medical professionals. Additionally, there is a need for a secure and privacy-centric approach to handling sensitive patient data during the diagnostic process. The key points of the problem statement are as follows:

* **Manual Ultrasound Analysis**: Current methods for diagnosing breast cancers using Ultrasound scans rely heavily on manual analysis by medical experts. This process can be time-consuming, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment planning.
* **Accuracy and Efficiency**: There is a demand for a more accurate and efficient cancer identification process to enable early detection and timely intervention, which significantly impacts patient outcomes and survival rates.
* **Lack of Comprehensive Information**: Patients often receive limited information about their specific breast cancer type, its characteristics, potential risks, and treatment options. Providing comprehensive insights is essential for informed decision-making and patient empowerment.
* **Data Privacy Concerns**: With increasing concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare, there is a critical need to ensure that patient data, including Ultrasound scans, is handled securely and not stored for privacy reasons.

## Solution: üí° 
In light of these challenges, **MammoScan Pro** aims to create an intelligent and privacy-focused solution that revolutionizes breast cancer diagnosis using AI-driven analysis. By leveraging the power of **Azure Custom Vision**, the application seeks to empower patients with comprehensive cancer insights and personalized treatment recommendations, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and enhanced breast health care.
